# Technical report: <your system's name>

At most 16 pages, the open problem included. It documents what was
deployed, not what was planned. Each section below matches one line of the
course rubric (points in brackets, 100 in all; the defense is a
separate 10 percent of the grade). Quote only numbers that a file in this repository holds.

## 1. Problem framing and scope (7)

The questions the system answers, tied to the competency questions and
measurable. What was left out, and why.

## 2. Data understanding and constraint discovery (12)

The source, its licence, and what one row means. The constraint inventory:
each constraint with the evidence in your data, and the ones you found false
in the data, reported rather than dropped.

## 3. Ontology (18)

The published vocabulary you reused and why it fits; the alignment outward;
the competency questions; the OWL profile; the reasoner run; the version IRI.
Every class and property answers a competency question.

## 4. Constraint validation with SHACL (15)

The shapes against the inventory; for each constraint, why SHACL and not OWL
(or the reverse); the triage of every failure (data defect or wrong
constraint); the gate in CI, with a red run it blocked.

## 5. Operational data integration (12)

The mapping; materialized and virtualized over the same data, and which one
the deployed system uses, argued on freshness, latency and workload; entity
resolution across two sources, with precision and recall on a labelled sample.

## 6. Prediction and evaluation honesty (13)

The graph built from the ontology; the node classification and link
prediction models; the split (temporal where time matters) and why it does
not leak; the baseline; several seeds and the spread. A model that loses to
the baseline, reported as such with an explanation, scores full marks.

## 7. Access layer (9)

The grounding (VoID, examples), the check and repair loop, the refusal path
on a real unanswerable question, and the score of your test set before and
after one improvement, with the model and the date.

## 8. Deployment and reproducibility (9)

The stack (`docker-compose.yml`), how it comes up from a clean checkout with
one command, provenance, the ontology's version, and what a clean checkout
test surfaced.

## 9. Open problem (5), at most 2 pages

One open problem from Session 7, stated as a question, connected to a
decision or limitation in your own system, with a position of your own, and
at least three primary sources you read.
